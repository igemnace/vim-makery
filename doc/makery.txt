Setup ~
                                                       *makery* *makery-setup*
Makery.vim allows you to specify different configurations of |makeprg|,
|errorformat|, and |compiler| for different projects by indicating them in a
|Dictionary|, like so:
>
  let g:makery_config = {
  \   "~/src/my-c-project": {
  \     "lint": {"compiler": "clang-format"},
  \     "tags": {"makeprg": "ctags -R src"},
  \     "build": {"compiler": "gcc"}
  \   },
  \   "~/src/my-js-project": {
  \     "lint": {"compiler": "eslint"},
  \     "tags": {"makeprg": "es-ctags -R src"},
  \     "build": {"makeprg": "yarn"},
  \     "test": {"compiler": "jest"}
  \   }
  \ }
<
                                                             *g:makery_config*
The global object |g:makery_config| should contain paths as keys. Ideally,
these paths should lead to your projects' root directories. You can use globs
in the path, e.g. `~/src/my-c-project/*`, but be aware that |:make| almost
always relies on the current working directory to work properly.

                                                          *makery-path-config*
Each path is provided with its own |Dictionary|. This dict will be a map from
command names to sets of |makeprg|, |errorformat|, and/or |compiler| options.

You can use any command name you wish for these options. Ideally, these
command names should be descriptive of what options it sets up, e.g. "lint",
"build", or "deploy".

Each command is, yet again, provided with its own |Dictionary|. This time, the
only relevant keys are "compiler", "makeprg", and "errorformat".

                                            *makery-compiler* *makery-makeprg*
You must specify at least one of "compiler" or "makeprg". If both are
provided, the |compiler| will be set before the |makeprg|.

This can be useful if you need a certain |compiler| plugin, but you're
invoking the |makeprg| in a different way, e.g.
>
  {
    "lint": {
      "compiler": "eslint",
      "makeprg": "yarn lint"
    }
  }
<

                                                          *makery-errorformat*
The "errorformat" key is optional, and will be ignored if you specify a
|compiler|. Ideally, you'll want to set this to the proper |errorformat| that
corresponds to your given |makeprg|.

Even better would be writing your own |compiler| plugin to group the two
together (see |write-compiler-plugin|). It's very simple; not at all as hard
as it sounds!

JSON Support ~
                                                                 *makery-json*
If you have Vim 8 or higher, makery.vim will be able to read JSON files for
its config in addition to |g:makery_config|.

Upon startup, makery.vim will search for a `.makery.json` file in the current
working directory and source it if it exists. This is a handy way of
specifying a |makery-path-config| for your project, since you won't have to
hardcode a path in your vimrc.

The content of `.makery.json` should be in the same format as described for
|makery-path-config|. For example, `~/src/my-js-project` might look like this:
>
  {
    "lint": {"compiler": "eslint"},
    "tags": {"makeprg": "es-ctags -R src"},
    "build": {"makeprg": "yarn"},
    "test": {"compiler": "jest"}
  }
<

Usage ~
                                              *makery-usage* *makery-commands*
After setting up, you can call any of your defined commands via the :M prefix.

For example, let's say I have the following |g:makery_config|:
>
  let g:makery_config = {
  \   "~/src/my-js-project": {
  \     "lint": {"compiler": "eslint"},
  \     "build": {"makeprg": "yarn"}
  \   }
  \ }
<
Opening Vim from `~/src/my-js-project` will provide me with the :Mlint
command, which will run |:make| with "eslint" as my |compiler|. I can lint a
single file with :Mlint %, or lint the entire project with :Mlint *.

After hacking a bit on my code and fixing my lint errors, I'm ready to build
my dist files. I can run the :Mbuild command, which will run |:make|, but this
time it will use "yarn" as its |makeprg|.

Async support ~
                                                  *makery-Make* *makery-async*
Makery.vim does not attempt to implement an async version of |:make|, since so
many plugins out there already do this.

Instead, makery.vim tries to use a :Make command, if one exists. This means
installing, say, tpope's dispatch.vim alongside makery.vim will be enough for
your :M commands to run async.

If you use a different plugin, you may look up its documentation for a clue on
how to provide a :Make command. For example, I use skywind3000's asyncrun.vim,
so I have the following line in my vimrc:
>
  command! -nargs=* Make AsyncRun -program=make <args>
<
